## [2.0.1] [[release](https://github.com/pilgrimlyieu/AutoHotkey-Script/releases/tag/OCRC-v2.0.1)] (2023-09-05)

> Generated by GitHub Copilot

It has been 16 months since the latest stable version of OCRC v1.2.2 was released, and it has been two weeks since the v2.0.0-beta.1 refactoring. In the past 6 beta versions (beta.1 and beta.5 were released), I have added functions, modified options, and fixed errors. And now it's time to release the stable version.

### Added

- General
  - Option to pop up a prompt when no screenshot is detected
  - Help prompt on the settings page
- Baidu OCR
  - Option to close the result window immediately after searching
  - Custom search engine support (see #21 for details)
  - Right-click quick search support (see #21 for details)
  - Translation support (see #23 for details)
    - Google Translate (supported, using two APIs. Proxy can be configured)
    - Tencent Translation (not supported yet. SecretID and SecretKey need to be configured)
- Options
  - `Basic_SnipWarning`
  - `Advance_GoogleTranslationProxy`
  - `Advance_TencentTranslationSecretID`
  - `Advance_TencentTranslationSecretKey`
  - `Baidu_TranslationEngine`
  - `Baidu_CloseAndSearch`
  - `Baidu_SearchEngines` section and the following default key values
    - `百度`: `https://www.baidu.com/s?wd=@W`
    - `谷歌`: `https://www.google.com/search?q=@W`
    - `必应`: `https://cn.bing.com/search?q=@W`
    - `百度百科`: `https://baike.baidu.com/item/@W`
    - `维基百科`: `https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/@W`

### Changed

- General
  - **BREAKING**: **REFACTOR code** (convert code from v1.1 to v2)
    - Use [`ahk-json.dll`](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=100602) written by [thqby](https://github.com/thqby) to parse and convert JSON, which is written in C++. It *may* improve runtime efficiency
  - **BREAKING**: Convert the configuration file name from `OCRC.privacy.ini` to `OCRC.ini`
  - Use `SnippingTool` instead of `ScreenClippingHost` as the default screenshot tool. So that it does not depend on the shortcut <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>
- **BREAKING**: Options
  - `Baidu_RecogType` -> `Baidu_RecognitionType`
  - `Baidu_ProbType` -> `Baidu_ProbabilityType`
  - `Baidu_PuncStyle` -> `Baidu_PunctuationStyle`
  - `Baidu_TranType` -> `Baidu_TranslationType`

### Removed

- General
  - Option to automatically restart after important settings are changed
- Baidu OCR
  - Removed search mirror sites (Google mirror and Wikipedia mirror)
  - Everything configuration related options
- **BREAKING**: Options
  - `Basic_AutoReloadOnOff`
  - `Advance_EverythingOnOff`
  - `Advance_EverythingPath`
